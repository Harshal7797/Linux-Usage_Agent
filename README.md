# Introduction 
Cluster Monitor Agent is an internal tool that monitors the cluster resources of Linux computers or nodes that work together and can be viewed and managed as a single system. Nodes may be physical or virtual machines, and they may be separated geographically. Organization use Linux cluster to reduce downtime and  provide high availability of the services.  A server cluster is a group of linked servers that work together to improve system performance and service availability. For example if a one server fails, other server in the cluster can take over the function and workload of the failed server.

# Usage


# Improvement

1) Handle Hardware Update 
2) Show Visual data of CPU usage like Windows Task Manager.
